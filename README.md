# planar-defect-analysis-algorithm (PDA)
Code for classifying various defects, including intrinstic and extrinsic stacking faults, twin boundaries and HCP phase in the FCC crystal. This code can work in the python script modifier of [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/). To use PDA, you must first activate the common neighbor analysis in the OVITO.
